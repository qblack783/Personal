# Personal Poem: A Love Written in Code

This is a **code-based narrative poem** — a creative expression of love, memory, truth, and longing — written using Python-style logic. It’s not a program you run, but a piece you *feel*. A digital journal of emotion structured like a script.

---

#Format

This piece uses **object-oriented metaphors** to express deeply personal memories, unspoken truths, and hopes for healing or reconnection.

It includes:
- **Real Memories** (recorded and shared)
- **Lies** (unspoken or denied)
- **Truths** (accepted and painful)
- **Willing Commitments** (given freely, not forced)
- A reflection on identity and the beloved’s name

#Sample Highlights

```python
us.add_memory(Memory("You tasted The Shed because I took you there", "LL"))
us.add_memory(Memory("Time on Park Ave weren’t about chatting but being with you in any way", "NY"))

us.add_lie("Missed FaceTimes blamed on bad service — especially on Thursdays")
us.add_truth("Loving someone doesn’t mean they’re yours")
us.add_willingly("Fall in love with you everyday, every second for the rest of my life")

your_name = ("a victorious shining star")
